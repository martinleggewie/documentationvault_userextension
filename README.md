# obsidian-vaultextension_user

A collection of files and folders which are supposed to extend another Obsidian vault by nifty usage of symbolic linking.

This repo is supposed to contain all files and folders which are specific to a given user and therefore cannot and/or must not be shared with any other user. Examples of such specific files are both user-specific settings like font size, themes, and so on, but also files which contain personal information which the user does not want to share with others.

To ease the pain of symbolic link all these files and folders, there are corresponding shell scripts which do the work for the user.
